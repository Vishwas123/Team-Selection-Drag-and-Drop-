# Team-Selection-Drag-and-Drop-
This is a drag and drop application which uses jQuery UI components for development.
We have to drag players from teams to the selection component to join them in our team. We can only select up to 11 players in our team. It will automatically lock after selecting 11 players. When we drag and drop a player from the respected team to our team, the player's name from the respective name is deleted and appears in our team.
A simple application that uses jQuery UI Library.
